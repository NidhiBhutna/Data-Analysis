# Data-Analysis

The Data Analysis using Python project involves using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze a dataset. Steps include data preprocessing, exploratory analysis for insights, visualization, statistical tests, and optionally, machine learning for predictions. Results are documented and presented to stakeholders for informed decision-making.
